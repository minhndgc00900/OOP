- "super" is used to acces/call the parent class members (variables and methods)
- "this" is used to to call the current class members (variables and methods).
this is required when we have a parameter with the same name as an instance variable (field)

*note: we can use both of them anywhere in a class except static areas(the static blocl or a
a static method). Any attempt to do so will lead to compile-time errors.

- "this" is commonly used with constructors and setters.
- "super" is commonly used with method overriding, when we call a method with the
same name from the parent class.

- "this()" can be used only in a constructor and it must be the first statement
in a constructor
- the only way to call a parent constructor is by calling "super()"
- the call to super() must be the first statement in each constructor

- Even abstract classes have constructors.
- An abstract class is still a super class, so its constructors run when someone
makes an instance of a concrete subclass
